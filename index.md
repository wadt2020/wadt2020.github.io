 25th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ALGEBRAIC DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES 2020

The 25th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques 2020 will be co-located with ETAPS 2020 in Dublin.

## Aims and scope

The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, aspect oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

WADT 2020 will have three thematic streams and one general stream:

* Graph Transformation – chair: Andrea Corradini, Italy
* System Modelling – chair: Alexander Knapp, Germany
* Deductive Software Verification – chair: Marieke Huismanm, The Netherlands
* General Stream - chair: Markus Roggenbach, UK

### Graph Transformation Stream

The graph transformation stream seeks contributions addressing theoretical, application oriented or tool related aspects of graph transformation, or any combination of them. Here is a non-exclusive list of topics:

- Foundations of algebraic and set-based approaches to graph transformation
- Relations between graph transformation and other computational models
- Analysis, verification, validation and testing of graph transformation systems
- Applications to software engineering, including software architectures, refactoring, business processes, access control and service-orientation
- Applications to computing paradigms such as bio-inspired, string diagrams, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual computing
- Tools based on or supporting the development of graph transformation systems.

### System Modelling Stream

The system modelling stream seeks contributions in the (co-)algebraic and model-based tradition of system specification and verification, for which typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

- Systems modelling
- System views and consistency
- Real-time, Hybrid, and Cyber-physical systems
- Modelling languages, like UML, SysML, etc., and their profiles
- Model transformations
- Model-based testing
- Tools for systems specification, testing, and verification
        
### General Stream

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest  for the general stream are: 
   
   - Foundations of algebraic specification
   - Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems
   - Specification languages, methods, and environments
   - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
   - Integration of formal specification techniques
   - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification
   - Algebraic approaches to cognitive sciences, including computational creativity

The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.
