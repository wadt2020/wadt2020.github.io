 25th INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ALGEBRAIC DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES 2020

The 25th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques 2020 will be co-located with ETAPS 2020 in Dublin.

## Aims and scope

The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, aspect oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.

The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3. 

Previous editions or the workshop include
* [WADT 2018](http://wadt18.cs.rhul.ac.uk)
* [WADT 2016](http://cs.swan.ac.uk/wadt16)
* [WADT 2014](http://wadt2014.cs.ovgu.de)
* [WADT 2012](http://maude.sip.ucm.es/wadt2012)

WADT 2020 will have three thematic streams and one general stream:

* Graph Transformation – chair: Andrea Corradini, Italy
* System Modelling – chair: Alexander Knapp, Germany
* Deductive Software Verification – chair: Marieke Huismanm, The Netherlands
* General Stream - chair: Markus Roggenbach, UK

### Graph Transformation Stream

The graph transformation stream seeks contributions addressing theoretical, application oriented or tool related aspects of graph transformation, or any combination of them. Here is a non-exclusive list of topics:

- Foundations of algebraic and set-based approaches to graph transformation
- Relations between graph transformation and other computational models
- Analysis, verification, validation and testing of graph transformation systems
- Applications to software engineering, including software architectures, refactoring, business processes, access control and service-orientation
- Applications to computing paradigms such as bio-inspired, string diagrams, quantum, ubiquitous, and visual computing
- Tools based on or supporting the development of graph transformation systems.

### System Modelling Stream

The system modelling stream seeks contributions in the (co-)algebraic and model-based tradition of system specification and verification, for which typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are:

- Systems modelling
- System views and consistency
- Real-time, Hybrid, and Cyber-physical systems
- Modelling languages, like UML, SysML, etc., and their profiles
- Model transformations
- Model-based testing
- Tools for systems specification, testing, and verification

### Deductive Software Verification Stream 

The deductive software verification stream seeks contributions addressing theoretical or tool-related contributions in the area of deductive software verification. Also experience reports are welcome. Here is a non-exclusive list of topics:

- Foundations of deductive software verification and program logics
- Advancing deductive software verification techniques to new programming languages, or different programming paradigms
- Automating deductive software verification
- Combinations of deductive software verification techniques with other formal methods
- Applications of deductive software verification on industrial case studies
 
This stream will be scheduled in such a way that there will be no overlap with the VerifyThis workshop at Etaps 2020.

### General Stream

Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest  for the general stream are: 
   
   - Foundations of algebraic specification
   - Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems
   - Specification languages, methods, and environments
   - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
   - Integration of formal specification techniques
   - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification
   - Algebraic approaches to cognitive sciences, including computational creativity
      
### Submission

The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of recent results and ongoing research. 
The presentations will be selected by the relevant PC Chair on the basis of submitted abstracts according to originality, significance and general interest. The abstracts must be up to two pages long including references. If a longer version of the contribution is available, it can be made accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.

The abstracts have to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair system using the following link: 

[Easychair link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wadt2020)

After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for the refereed post-proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed by the WADT 2020 PC; selection will be based on originality, soundness and significance of the presented ideas and results. The proceedings will be published as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer. The deadline for submissions will be 19.5.2020 , with notifications of acceptance by 26.6.2020. Camera-ready versions will be required by 17.7.2020.
